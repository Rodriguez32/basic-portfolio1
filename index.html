                I am currently enrolled at Northwestern University School of Professional Studies, in the Coding Bootcamp. Although, coding is new to me. I am eager to work in this field because I 
                like to learn, build and make things work.
            <br>
                I live in the Northwest side of Chicago. As a mother of two, my schedule changes daily. From school to soccer or doctor appointments. My kids motivate and inspire me. I feel the need to keep growing professionally and teaching my 
                children we can all reach our goals.
              
                On my spare time I like to read, bake and experiment with new recipes. I also enjoy jewelry making,excercise and practicing mindfulness meditation.  </p>
